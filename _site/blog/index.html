<p>One of the most comforting truths I often come back to is in the fluid nature of the self. For some people, that truth is terrifying. The prospect of changing yourself on an inner level is a Lovecraftian horror to them. But whether or not you consciously try to become someone else, it happens anyway. You are not a static being. You are slowly transmuting everyday without even noticing.

      </p>

<p>For the people who have known me for at least the last 10+ years, it goes without saying that I am a very different person from who I was in my teenage years or even my early 20s. Recently, I reconnected with a number of people I hadn’t spoken to since high school. I’d only realize just how much time has passed once they mentioned the typical milestones of adulthood like marriage, children, and stable careers. I had none of those things to speak of. For them, the timeskip from my end was marked by a seemingly 180 shift in personality.</p>

<p><em>“You were SO shy and quiet!”</em> They’d say as I told them about the last few years of my life. The awkward Asian kid with a barely-perceptable voice, who would duck at any sight of a camera, was now talking about her life abroad, a brief stint as a cam girl, and how she hurled condoms into the crowd during a standup comedy performance.</p>

<p>My newly bloomed self-confidence has resulted in a new persona, but what’s changed about me even more than what could be seen on the surface, is my internal relationship with myself and the world around me.</p>

<p>I’ll be the first to tell you that as a teenager, I was blighted by shallow cynicism. I thought having the mantra of “I hate everyone” was a personality trait. I thought I was cooler than the normies because I listened to obscure indie bands that now bore me. I suffered from Main Character Syndrome so hard I thought I was the only person in the world crying myself to sleep at night. I didn’t <em>actually</em> hate the world. I only told myself I did because I thought the world hated <em>me</em>. I used cynicism as a defense mechanism against my deep feelings of loneliness. I longed for a real connection with someone, and yet I was a complete wallflower. I would walk up to groups of people and stand there for 5 minutes before they noticed. If I finally mustered up the nerve to say something, they didn’t hear me. Aside from my questionable and strange sense of fashion (literal granny glasses and mom jeans before they were cool), I was painfully average and unnoteworthy. Combine that with your typical teenage angst and undiagnosed depression, you had a recipe for a self-absorbed misanthrope.</p>

<p>My self-worth and isolation slowly improved as I got older, but my cynicism and egocentric attitude remained–and I think it had a lot to do with my general lack of empathy. It took me a long time to realize it, but the baseline level of empathy I’d been running on was not normal, most likely as a result of having emotionally absent parents who dismissed my feelings constantly. I didn’t understand how movies could make people cry. I would make jokes about how “sentimental” one of my friends was for reacting strongly to things that moved her. I had trouble recognizing what people were feeling, and when I did, I didn’t feel it with them. The most emotion I’d ever feel was for myself: the anguish and self-pity of depression. Ironically, this was because my lack of empathy also extended to myself. My self-indulgent pity parties were because instead of trying to love myself, I wanted others to do it for me. I needed my worth to be validated by others. After all, if I’m worthless, then so are my opinions, right?</p>

<p>Luckily, as I said at the beginning of this post, people change, whether we try to or not. I didn’t stay this way forever. I’ve grown into a much more empathetic person, and I attribute that to two main catalysts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>My best friend and former partner, D.</li>
  <li>Psychedelics.</li>
</ol>

<p>I met D as I was coming out of my first relationship, emotionally battered and having no idea what a healthy relationship looked like. D could have easily been a mediocre boyfriend and I’d have been none the wiser. But what fell into my lap was someone who not only met the bare minimum requirements of a not-shitty partner, but surpassed them to the point where I almost feel sorry for anyone who’s never had a relationship like ours. D was the foil to my callousness. He connected with things and felt emotions at an intensity I couldn’t understand. He had an overwhelming capacity for compassion and kindness, and he accepted me in a way I had never experienced before. He was the first person to show me what being loved could and should feel like.</p>

<p>And so, I slowly began to change. I wanted to be someone worthy of the love he had for me. I wanted to be a better person–I wanted to be more like him. And while the effort I put in improved my <em>cognitive empathy</em> and I learned to recognize other people’s emotions better, I still struggled to engage with those emotions.</p>

<p>And this is where the magic of 𝓹𝓼𝔂𝓬𝓱𝓮𝓭𝓮𝓵𝓲𝓬𝓼 comes in.</p>

<p>I ventured on my first trip, naturally, with D. It was a first for both of us. I think like many people who’d never done psychedelics before, we had <em>some</em> idea of what we were in for, but you’re never truly prepared for where those kind of drugs will take you. We drank our psilocybin tea and proceeded to enjoy a few hours of lighthearted psychonaut rookie antics. I lay strung over the sofa, subdued by a 10 minute laughing fit. I stared in awe at the technicolour rays coming out of my phone screen. D and his roommates spectated in amusement as I battled a boss in Dark Souls (a notoriously hard game that only shrooms could give me the confidence to try my hand at).</p>

<p>We devoured our amuse-bouche thinking it was the main course. Soon enough our good time morphed into a joint “bad trip.” I use quotation marks because it wasn’t so much a bad trip as it was an overdue cleansing of the soul. All the pain I’d relegated to the background as white noise or otherwise never validated had surfaced with a vengeance. Like perfect clockwork D and I took turns sobbing and comforting each other about our respective traumas. As I cried, it felt different from all the previous times I would cry for myself. This time I wasn’t feeling sorry for myself. I was simply <em>feeling.</em> I was crying out of empathy for myself, making my body a vessel for the wounded child who didn’t have a voice for so long. Concurrent to my newly awakened self-empathy was my empathy for another. I felt what D was feeling too, crying for him just as much as I did for myself, and we sat together in the shared pain of our lonely childhoods. That was the first of several more psychedelic trips that helped me connect with my stifled emotions.</p>

<p>I don’t want to imply that my transformation into a better person was the result of a fairytale romance where my life was saved by a perfect man and magical potions, because it was a much more complicated journey than that, involving many mistakes, regrets, and difficult personal epiphanies. I remember one of the very first fights D and I ever had, where out of an unhealthy reflex carried over from my abusive relationship, I’d told him to go kill himself without blinking an eye. I remember the look on his face that told me just how much damage I was coming into our relationship with, and I never said anything like that to him again.</p>

<p>My general empathy level is still lower than normal, which can sometimes make me seem cold or insensitive to those who don’t know me well, but I’ve come a long way from who I used to be. Thanks to a combination of (responsible) drug use and active self-improvement efforts, I am now much more patient and less judgmental. I cry during sad movies, and I’m not bothered by people who do things differently from me. I’ve become less self-centered and more in tune with the people I love. It’s a work-in-progress, and each day that I put in the effort, I become a slightly happier version of myself. When I look back at my 16-year-old self, I don’t do it with embarrassment or judgment anymore. Instead, I wish I could tell her to love herself the way I love her now. And see the look on her face when I also tell her that one day she’d be saying “I love life” without the sarcastic sneer in her voice.</p>

    </div>
    
    <div class="content-body">
        <p>Up until recently, when much of the world was stuck in a purgatory of lockdown restrictions, us lucky ones in Vietnam were basking in the luxuries of triple digit covid numbers and loose social distancing measures. Now the tables have turned, and not only have we been under a strict lockdown for the past 4 months, but those of us residing in Saigon are even under a military-enforced lockdown.

<p>Many people, understandably, are going stir-crazy under the isolation and falling into depression.</p>

<p>WELCOME TO MY WORLD. I’m a fuckin’ homebody. I fear the outside world more than I fear my own internal dialogue. I literally lived in a dark basement for half my life. I am a veteran of this lifestyle.</p>

<p>Take my hand. I will lead you through this scary terrain with some tips for maintaining your physical and mental wellbeing via healthy routines and habits under lockdown.</p>

<h2 id="take-your-meds">Take your meds.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005516/blogposts/meds_zj4p1a.gif" /></p>

<p>If you are on any medication, make sure to take them every day. Take them first thing in the morning so you don’t forget. Unless you already took them when you got up at 4am this morning before going back to bed just to get it out of the way. Shit. Did I take my dose already or not? Aw hell. Okay, just set an alarm for your meds and hope you don’t accidentally double dose on your SSRIs.</p>

<h2 id="start-the-day-off-with-a-hearty-breakfast">Start the day off with a hearty breakfast.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005518/blogposts/breakfast_z0ionn.gif" /></p>

<p>Eggs are a breakfast staple for a reason. Cheap, easy to cook, and loaded with protein to get you energized for the day. We’re all groggy and lazy in the morning–you don’t want to spend ages prepping just to get a filling breakfast in you–so I’ve developed a very streamlined process for cooking my eggs.</p>

<p>First, I heat up my skillet. I recommend cast iron since it doubles as both a tool of cookery <em>and</em> weightlifting, to get those saggy arms nice and ripped just from tossing stir-fries. Get the leftover oil from whatever I cooked last night nice and hot (frugal hack). Crack my egg on a FLAT surface to avoid getting shell pieces in my beautiful sunny-side up. Get shell pieces in there anyway. Use one half of the egg shell to remove those pieces (cooking hack). Break the yolk of my beautiful sunny-side up in the process. Try not to internalize it as a metaphor for my life and cry. Place the egg on some cold leftover rice, because at this point I couldn’t be assed to heat it up anymore. Enjoy!</p>

<h2 id="stretch-your-muscles">Stretch your muscles.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005516/blogposts/stretch_x6kbnj.gif" /></p>

<p>Especially under lockdown, you probably sit at your computer a lot, hunched over and sitting with poor posture all day. I do at least 10 minutes of yoga every morning to help with tight muscles and stiff joints. You don’t need to pull off complicated poses or wrap your legs around your head in order to enjoy the benefits of yoga. Sun Salutations are a great and simple way to get your muscles warmed up. Start by standing straight, arms to the side and palms facing forward. Inhale as you lift your arms up to the sky. As you exhale, lower your arms and fold forward at your hips–Oh god what was that popping sound?</p>

<h2 id="suck-it-up-and-take-a-cold-shower">Suck it up and take a COLD shower.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005518/blogposts/shower_cty4dv.gif" /></p>

<p>A cold shower in the morning will help wake you up, and not only is it good for developing your mental strength, it has a host of health benefits such as improving your circulation and metabolism. And I’m not just saying this to console myself over the fact that I don’t have a water heater.</p>

<h2 id="try-aromatherapy">Try aromatherapy.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005516/blogposts/diffuser_lwhogi.gif" /></p>

<p>Diffusers are totally worth the investment. Essential oils offer a variety health effects and make your home smell like a dang spa. Lemongrass for example can help with nausea. Just add 5 drops to your diffuser. Add 5 more if the scent seems a little weak. Maybe another 5 drops. Still can’t smell anything? Fuck it just dump 10 more in. Now let the diffuser do its thing and enjoy your naturally-fragranced home. That… might have been too much. Ugh, the smell is making me nauseous. All right, go ahead and open your windows to let some fresh air circulate. Oh, and while you do that, try not to drop the ashtray filled with a week’s worth of cigarette butts out the window. Your neighbours won’t be too happy with you.</p>

<h2 id="treat-yourself-to-a-spa-day">Treat yourself to a spa day.</h2>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dqmzgagnv/image/upload/v1633005518/blogposts/spa_jnwjpo.gif" /></p>

<p>You have all this free time, why not set some of it aside to pamper yourself as a form of self-care? Put on a sheetmask! And exfoliate those icky feet for once. Pumice stones are the way to go, but if you don’t have one, you can use a nail clipper to trim off the callouses left by your ill-fitting Birkenstocks. Oh. That’s um… that’s a lot of blood. I better go and take care of that.</p>

<p>That’s all my tips for today, I hope you found them useful. These are hard, uncertain times, but you <em>are</em> in control. There’s no need to be depressed. Just remember to live, laugh, love (and maybe stock up on bandaids). See you next time!</p>

    </div>

<p>This is my bass guitar, Doom. It’s not a particularly cool or expensive guitar. No fancy pickups, no custom body, nothing. Two of the knobs have even taken it upon themselves to fall off when I practice. It’s basic. It’s boring. And it’s one of the most important things I own.

    </div>
    <input type="checkbox" class="read-more-state" id="/doom-x-heartbreak/"/>
    <div class="read-more content-body blog-post-sig">
      </p>

<p>I bought Doom over a year ago from a small shop on Guitar Street in Saigon. My then-boyfriend (henceforth referred to as X) and I had returned there a week after spending the better part of an afternoon going from shop to shop in search of a used bass guitar. The one we finally came upon was not only new, but just as cheap as the used ones we’d looked at. I sat by as X tested it out, occasionally having a chat with the shopkeeper in a mixture of his broken Vietnamese and the shopkeeper’s broken English. Despite my failed attempt at haggling down the price, I decided to bite the bullet, and walked out proudly with a shiny new bass slung over my back. The experience was only made better by X’s shared excitement about my new toy.</p>

<p>I don’t remember how or when I arrived at the decision to start playing bass, or if it was even my idea for that matter. I just remember that at some point, X had started roping me into practicing riffs on his acoustic guitar on a regular basis. I’d been interested in playing bass for a long time, but never had the confidence to follow through with learning. It always seemed too intimidating, too much work, too outside the realm of my abilities. But for some reason, X was really determined to get me learning. Before I knew it I was playing guitar and <em>enjoying</em> it. Wtf? It was as if he casted a spell that lifted away all my doubts and hangups about being able to play an instrument.</p>

<p>It wasn’t magic though. X was not only a skilled guitarist, but an equally great teacher. He pushed me just enough to get my fingers on the frets and practice until I lost all sense of time. He explained theory with the curiosity of a scientist and the passion of an artist. He gave me exercises that were just enough of a challenge to activate my hyperfocus, but not so much that I wanted to give up. I finally felt like music was something I could feasibly pursue and not just something I’d dabble in for short bursts of time, ultimately leading nowhere.</p>

<p>X was best music teacher I ever had. He was also the worst boyfriend I ever had.</p>

<p>The music lessons were a small patch of weeds in the middle of a desert wasteland. For all the good X cultivated in that pocket of our relationship, he did tenfold the damage in the rest of it. When I say X was the worst boyfriend I ever had, I don’t say so casually. I even debated whether he took that spot over my first boyfriend who emotionally abused me for nearly 4 years. But when I think about the impact X had on me over the course of the year we were together, in proportion to my overall mental stability (I was a much less resilient and stable person during my first relationship), I’d say the ppm of toxicity X brought to my life is unmatched.</p>

<p>9 months into our relationship I discovered that X had been cheating on me from the beginning of our relationship. He’d been sexting numerous girls across all social apps available. He even solicited prostitutes. He kept all of this a secret from me. One day he tried to convince someone come to his apartment to sleep with him. The next day I met up with him. I gave him four origami flowers with poetry written inside as a Valentine’s day gift. He gave me herpes.</p>

<p>This doesn’t even break the surface of everything he did to me. To be clear, he never laid his hands on me–it’s not in his nature to be violent. What he <em>did</em> do was lie to me, gaslight me, and maim me emotionally to the point where I became suicidal. It’s been over 7 months since I last spoke to him, and some days I can still feel the cuts he left throb in my soul.</p>

<p>The thing about abusive relationships, what makes them so hard to walk away from, is the rare moments of emotional bliss you get to enjoy in between all the fights and tears. Those vignettes of happiness that you reminisce on years later. I wouldn’t wish what X did to me on anyone, but I can’t lie and say that I don’t cherish the breadcrumb moments that had me hanging on desperately to a relationship that was killing me on the inside. All those times we were in perfect harmony and felt nothing but pure love for each other.</p>

<p>Lighting each other’s cigarettes during breaks at comedy shows.</p>

<p>The nights of getting high and cooking dinner together.</p>

<p>Flying down by the canal at night on his Honda Dream singing our favourite songs.</p>

<p>And of course, the hours he spent teaching me how to play guitar like no one else could. Showing a level of patience, support, and encouragement that would fool anyone about his capacity as a boyfriend. I play bass now because of him. I bought Doom, my very first guitar, with him. His memory is intrinsically tied to the massive object that sits in my room staring at me every day.</p>

<p>I still feel pangs of anger when I think about X and the things he did to me. Some days when I ruminate too much I even wish he was dead. For the most part, however, I feel much more stable and content than I ever have. I can pick up Doom and play a song X had taught me without being overcome with painful memories.</p>

<p>And that is why Doom is so important to me. It’s not just a cheap instrument. It’s not a reminder of one of the worst times of my life.</p>

<p>It’s a totem for my newfound resilience and strength. I can reconcile the darkest days of my life with the best days, and the dualisms that can exist in others. Life isn’t perfect, and people most certainly aren’t. I’m going forward with my life knowing that whatever happens to me, it doesn’t have to become baggage.</p>

        <p>After almost 2 weeks of blood, sweat and tears (only the sweat part is literal) I’ve finally launched this godforsaken thing.</p>

<p>It technically didn’t have to take this long–50% of the work was spent on refining my knowledge of CSS and learning useful things like SASS in order to optimize the shit out of my code. My life might be a mess but my CSS styles don’t have to be.

    <div class="read-more content-body blog-post-sig">
      </p>

<p>It was a long, arduous process, and you know what? It was 100% worth it. This was the first serious project in a long time that I was able to dedicate myself to all the way to completion. In fact, I’m writing this post off 3 hours of sleep because I couldn’t unglue my eyes from the screen last night. I was tweaking and tuning, typing and deleting hundreds of curly brackets, wondering why the fuck a new margin or link wouldn’t render whenever there was a missing or displaced quotation mark. As annoying as all that might sound I actually had a blast. I love the problem-solving element of coding, and in combination with my creative skills I get to build something that is completely mine which gives me a real juicy sense of accomplishment.</p>

<p>Now that this blog is finally up I have a new commitment to hold myself accountable for. No one asked for it, and maybe no one even wants it. But idgaf, I made this thing for me. My plan is to try and post at least once a week. Knowing my tendencies, there’s a good chance I’ll lose my enthusiasm and ditch the whole thing as quickly as I decided to pursue it. But at this moment, after 3 months under lockdown, I am stoked to challenge myself to a new project and routine.</p>

<p>Now please excuse me while I find more novelty animations to squeeze in.</p>
