<p>After almost 2 weeks of blood, sweat and tears (only the sweat part is literal) I've finally launched this godforsaken thing.
</p>
<p>It technically didn't have to take this longâ€”50% of the work was spent on refining my knowledge of CSS and learning useful things like SASS in order to optimize the shit out of my code. My life might be a mess but my CSS styles don't have to be. <!--more-->
</p>
<p>It was a long, arduous process, and you know what? It was 100% worth it. This was the first serious project in a long time that I was able to dedicate myself to all the way to completion. In fact, I'm writing this post off 3 hours of sleep because I couldn't unglue my eyes from the screen last night. I was tweaking and tuning, typing and deleting hundreds of curly brackets, wondering why the fuck a new margin or link wouldn't render whenever there was a missing or displaced quotation mark. As annoying as all that might sound I actually had a blast. I love the problem-solving element of coding, and in combination with my creative skills I get to build something that is completely mine which gives me a real juicy sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>Now that this blog is finally up I have a new commitment to hold myself accountable for. No one asked for it, and maybe no one even wants it. But idgaf, I made this thing for me. My plan is to try and post at least once a week. Knowing my tendencies, there's a good chance I'll lose my enthusiasm and ditch the whole thing as quickly as I decided to pursue it. But at this moment, after 3 months under lockdown, I am stoked to challenge myself to a new project and routine.</p>
<p>Now please excuse me while I find more novelty animations to squeeze in.</p>
