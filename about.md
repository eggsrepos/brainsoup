    <p>An. Also referred to as Egg. Sometimes "fucking pothead" or "demon."</p>
    <p>Made in Canada, currently living in Vietnam. Daddy was a fisherman and mommy raised me on pasta puttanesca.</p>
    <p>I graduated with an illustration degree and now do standup comedy, which earned me a giant <a href="#gd">glass dildo</a> earlier this year at a comedy competition.
    I dig horror movies and practical effects. My favourite video game is Bioshock and my favourite bands are Mr. Bungle, Melvins, and Primus. My buttermilk pancakes are amazing. No that wasn't a euphemism for anything. I make really good pancakes.</p>

    <h2>"Why did you call your blog Brain Soup?"</h2>
    <p>1) It's creamy and delicious but sounds horrifying to those who aren't open-minded.</p>
    <p>2) This is a place for me to dump the omnidirectional thoughts that swirl around in my ADHD-laden brain like an overseasoned soup.
