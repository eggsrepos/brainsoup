    An. Also referred to as Egg. Sometimes "fucking pothead" or "demon."
    <p>
    Made in Canada and currently living in Vietnam. Daddy was a fisherman and mommy raised me on pasta puttanesca.
    I graduated with an illustration degree and now do standup comedy, which earned me a giant glass dildo earlier this year at a comedy competition.
    I dig horror movies and practical effects. My favourite video game is Bioshock and my favourite band is Melvins.

<p><strong>"Why did you call your blog Brain Soup?"</strong></p>
<p>1) It's creamy and delicious but sounds weird/disgusting to those who aren't open-minded.</p>
<p>2) This is a place for me to dump the omnidirectional thoughts that swirl around in my ADHD-laden brain like an overseasoned soup.
