message: "your openness is inspiring to me especially because i have been feeling so mistrusting of ppl after my last relationship. i have been holding onto so much anger, but i need to see it for what it was, the good and bad, just like what the totem invokes. u here inspired me to pick a (conceptual) totem myself and see through its eyes, and it's let me release a lot of this stuff inside of me. interesting how shifting a point of perspective, namely from my own mind to an object, and trying to see thru it, can really unlock a lot of circling thoughts that had gotten stuck into loops into new pathways.\r\n\r\nstoked to read more from you dude, as always. your style reads like butter. sprung forth from the heart: the inside is the outside.\r\n\r\n\\m/"
