One of the most comforting truths I often come back to is in the fluid nature of the self. For some people, that truth is terrifying. The prospect of changing yourself on an inner level is a Lovecraftian horror to them. But whether or not you consciously try to become someone else, it happens anyway. You are not a static being. You are slowly transmuting everyday without even noticing.

For the people who have known me for at least the last 10+ years, it goes without saying that I am a very different person from who I was in my teenage years or even my early 20s. Recently, I reconnected with a number of people I hadn't spoken to since high school. I'd only realize just how much time has passed once they mentioned the typical milestones of adulthood like marriage, children, and stable careers. I had none of those things to speak of. For them, the timeskip from my end was marked by a seemingly 180 shift in personality.

*"You were SO shy and quiet!"* They'd say as I told them about the last few years of my life. The awkward Asian kid with a barely-perceptable voice, who would duck at any sight of a camera, was now talking about her life abroad, a brief stint as a cam girl, and how she hurled condoms into the crowd during a standup comedy performance.

My newly bloomed self-confidence has resulted in a new persona, but what's changed about me even more than what could be seen on the surface, is my internal relationship with myself and the world around me.

I'll be the first to tell you that as a teenager, I was blighted by shallow cynicism. I thought having the mantra of "I hate everyone" was a personality trait. I thought I was cooler than the normies because I listened to obscure indie bands that now bore me. I suffered from Main Character Syndrome so hard I thought I was the only person in the world crying myself to sleep at night. I didn't *actually* hate the world. I only told myself I did because I thought the world hated *me*. I used cynicism as a defense mechanism against my deep feelings of loneliness. I longed for a real connection with someone, and yet I was a complete wallflower. I would walk up to groups of people and stand there for 5 minutes before they noticed. If I finally mustered up the nerve to say something, they didn't hear me. Aside from my questionable and strange sense of fashion (literal granny glasses and mom jeans before they were cool), I was painfully average and unnoteworthy. Combine that with your typical teenage angst and undiagnosed depression, you had a recipe for a self-absorbed misanthrope.

My self-worth and isolation slowly improved as I got older, but my cynicism and egocentric attitude remained--and I think it had a lot to do with my general lack of empathy. It took me a long time to realize it, but the baseline level of empathy I'd been running on was not normal, most likely as a result of having emotionally absent parents who dismissed my feelings constantly. I didn't understand how movies could make people cry. I would make jokes about how "sentimental" one of my friends was for reacting strongly to things that moved her. I had trouble recognizing what people were feeling, and when I did, I didn't feel it with them. The most emotion I'd ever feel was for myself: the anguish and self-pity of depression. Ironically, this was because my lack of empathy also extended to myself. My self-indulgent pity parties were because instead of trying to love myself, I wanted others to do it for me. I needed my worth to be validated by others. After all, if I'm worthless, then so are my opinions, right?

Luckily, as I said at the beginning of this post, people change, whether we try to or not. I didn't stay this way forever. I've grown into a much more empathetic person, and I attribute that to two main catalysts:

1. My best friend and former partner, D.
2. Psychedelics.

I met D as I was coming out of my first relationship, emotionally battered and having no idea what a healthy relationship looked like. D could have easily been a mediocre boyfriend and I'd have been none the wiser. But what fell into my lap was someone who not only met the bare minimum requirements of a not-shitty partner, but surpassed them to the point where I almost feel sorry for anyone who's never had a relationship like ours. D was the foil to my callousness. He connected with things and felt emotions at an intensity I couldn't understand. He had an overwhelming capacity for compassion and kindness, and he accepted me in a way I had never experienced before. He was the first person to show me what being loved could and should feel like.

And so, I slowly began to change. I wanted to be someone worthy of the love he had for me. I wanted to be a better person--I wanted to be more like him. And while the effort I put in improved my *cognitive empathy* and I learned to recognize other people's emotions better, I still struggled to engage with those emotions. 

And this is where the magic of ùìπùìºùîÇùì¨ùì±ùìÆùì≠ùìÆùìµùì≤ùì¨ùìº comes in.

I ventured on my first trip, naturally, with D. It was a first for both of us. I think like many people who'd never done psychedelics before, we had *some* idea of what we were in for, but you're never truly prepared for where those kind of drugs will take you. We drank our psilocybin tea and proceeded to enjoy a few hours of lighthearted psychonaut rookie antics. I lay strung over the sofa, subdued by a 10 minute laughing fit. I stared in awe at the technicolour rays coming out of my phone screen. D and his roommates spectated in amusement as I battled a boss in Dark Souls (a notoriously hard game that only shrooms could give me the confidence to try my hand at).

We devoured our amuse-bouche thinking it was the main course. Soon enough our good time morphed into a joint "bad trip." I use quotation marks because it wasn't so much a bad trip as it was an overdue cleansing of the soul. All the pain I'd relegated to the background as white noise or otherwise never validated had surfaced with a vengeance. Like perfect clockwork D and I took turns sobbing and comforting each other about our respective traumas. As I cried, it felt different from all the previous times I would cry for myself. This time I wasn't feeling sorry for myself. I was simply *feeling.* I was crying out of empathy for myself, making my body a vessel for the wounded child who didn't have a voice for so long. Concurrent to my newly awakened self-empathy was my empathy for another. I felt what D was feeling too, crying for him just as much as I did for myself, and we sat together in the shared pain of our lonely childhoods. That was the first of several more psychedelic trips that helped me connect with my stifled emotions.

I don't want to imply that my transformation into a better person was the result of a fairytale romance where my life was saved by a perfect man and magical potions, because it was a much more complicated journey than that, involving many mistakes, regrets, and difficult personal epiphanies. I remember one of the very first fights D and I ever had, where out of an unhealthy reflex carried over from my abusive relationship, I'd told him to go kill himself without blinking an eye. I remember the look on his face that told me just how much damage I was coming into our relationship with, and I never said anything like that to him again.

My general empathy level is still lower than normal, which can sometimes make me seem cold or insensitive to those who don't know me well, but I've come a long way from who I used to be. Thanks to a combination of (responsible) drug use and active self-improvement efforts, I am now much more patient and less judgmental. I cry during sad movies, and I'm not bothered by people who do things differently from me. I've become less self-centered and more in tune with the people I love. It's a work-in-progress, and each day that I put in the effort, I become a slightly happier version of myself. When I look back at my 16-year-old self, I don't do it with embarrassment or judgment anymore. Instead, I wish I could tell her to love herself the way I love her now. And see the look on her face when I also tell her that one day she'd be saying "I love life" without the sarcastic sneer in her voice.
